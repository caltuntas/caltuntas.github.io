I bookmarked famous [How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) article many years ago and strongly recommend reading the whole article.
However before you start, I must say that it might not be the classical Hacker who illegally accesses to a system and steals the information as you expect.
It's a great writing about the definion of a real hacker, how they behave and how to become one of these. My favourite part is following

Zen poem

To follow the path:
look to the master,
follow the master,
walk with the master,
see through the master,
become the master.
